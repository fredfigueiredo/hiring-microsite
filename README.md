To build this site we used [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/), specifically the [Creative](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) template, based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).

We also used the [Lightbox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) project, by Lokesh Dhakar.
